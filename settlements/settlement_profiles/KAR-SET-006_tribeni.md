# KAR-SET-006: Simruth

*Generated 2026-10-02 by `analysis/hazard_exposure/compile_karnali_79.py` from the province-wide
screening run. All numbers are **derived** from the open datasets listed below; nothing here is a
field observation or a validated result. Sections marked "researcher input" are intentionally empty.*

## Observed transformation

**Derived (GHSL R2023A built-up surface, ha, 100 m grid):**

- Whole window: 1975: 5.9 | 1980: 6.1 | 1985: 6.5 | 1990: 7.0 | 1995: 7.4 | 2000: 8.5 | 2005: 10.2 | 2010: 13.7 | 2015: 18.6 | 2020: 26.0
- Inside the HAND <= 10 m zone: 1975: 0.1 | 1980: 0.1 | 1985: 0.1 | 1990: 0.1 | 1995: 0.1 | 2000: 0.2 | 2005: 0.2 | 2010: 0.5 | 2015: 0.7 | 2020: 1.4

**Visual observations from the image series:** researcher input. Record each in
`case_studies/.../metadata/observation_log.csv` style: image ID, feature, observed change, confidence.

## Hazard context (water-level scenarios)

![Scenarios](../../outputs/figures/karnali_79/water_level_scenarios/KAR-SET-006_tribeni_water_level_scenarios.png)

| Scenario | Buildings in zone | Share of window buildings | Zone area in window (ha) |
|---|---|---|---|
| HAND <= 2 m | 95 | 3.2% | 53.2 |
| HAND <= 5 m | 169 | 5.6% | 67.2 |
| HAND <= 10 m | 228 | 7.6% | 88.2 |

Province rank by buildings with HAND <= 5 m: **10 of 79** (1 = most).

## Evidence

- Imagery: Landsat Collection 2 (USGS) and Sentinel-2 L2A (ESA Copernicus) via Microsoft Planetary Computer (scene IDs above; catalogued in `data/metadata/imagery_catalog.csv`).
- DEM: Copernicus GLO-30 (`Copernicus_DSM_COG_10_N28_00_E082_00_DEM`).
- Channels, places, buildings: Overture Maps 2026-09-23.1.
- Built-up history: JRC GHS-BUILT-S R2023A.

## Interpretation

Researcher input. The derived numbers show where buildings sit on low ground relative to mapped
drainage; they do not by themselves establish flood probability, depth, or risk to life.

## Uncertainty

- HAND from a 30 m DEM: vertical error of several metres in steep terrain; narrow gorges and small
  channels are poorly resolved; unmapped streams are missing from the drainage network.
- Scenario zones are static terrain thresholds, not modelled floods: no discharge, return period,
  velocity, debris flow, landslide-dam outburst or bank erosion is represented.
- Building footprints combine OSM and ML-derived datasets of different dates; counts are not people.
- 1970s Landsat MSS (60 m, false colour) cannot resolve individual buildings; sensor, season and
  resolution differ between epochs.

## Follow-up analysis

- [ ] Confirm the settlement point and name with local knowledge.
- [ ] Record visual observations per epoch (river channel shifts, new construction on floodplain/fan).
- [ ] Check flood/debris-flow history for this location (e.g. DesInventar Nepal, BIPAD portal).
- [ ] If prioritised: higher-resolution DEM and a hydraulic model with design discharges.
